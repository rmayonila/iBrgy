# iBrgy Mobile App Services

This repository contains the mobile client and supporting service integration for the iBrgy (Barangay) mobile application. The app provides barangay-level services such as announcements, emergency hotlines, account management, and moderator/admin workflows, integrated primarily with Firebase.

Project

Name: ibrgy_mobile_app_services
Platform: Flutter (Android, iOS, web, Windows, macOS, Linux)
Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)

Repository Structure

- lib/: Main Dart source code.
  - admin/, moderator/, user/: Feature folders for role-specific UI and logic.
  - models/: Data model classes (e.g., subscription_tier.dart).
  - services/: Service classes that wrap Firebase interactions, networking, and business logic.
  - utils/, widgets/: Shared utilities and reusable UI components.
- android/, ios/, web/, windows/, macos/, linux/: Platform-specific projects and configuration.
- assets/: App assets (images, fonts).
- firebase.json, firestore.rules, storage.rules: Firebase configuration and security rules.
- pubspec.yaml: Dart/Flutter dependencies and assets.

Key Features & Functions

- Authentication: Email/password and Firebase-backed auth flows located in login and account pages (login_page.dart, account pages in admin/ and user/).
- Role-based UI: Separate flows for Admin, Moderator, and User roles with pages such as admin_home.dart, manage_moderators_page.dart, and moderator-specific views.
- Announcements: Create, update, and view announcements via announcement_page.dart and supporting services.
- Emergency Hotline: View and manage emergency contacts via emergency_hotline_page.dart.
- Audit Logging: Activities recorded for accountability (see audit_log_service.dart).
- Account Management: Create moderator accounts, change passwords, and manage user settings.
- Firebase Integration: Firestore for data, Storage for media, and optional Cloud Functions for server-side logic.

How It Works (High-level)

- The app initializes Firebase using firebase_options.dart (auto-generated by the FlutterFire CLI).
- On start (main.dart), the app checks authentication and routes users to the appropriate home screen based on role.
- Security rules in firestore.rules and storage.rules enforce role-based access on the backend.

Architecture & Data Flow

- Presentation: Flutter widgets (pages, components) in lib/ render UI, capture user input, and show state.
- Application Logic: Services in lib/services/ implement business rules, data validation, and map UI calls to backend operations.
- Data Layer: Firestore is the canonical store for documents (users, announcements, hotline contacts, audit logs). Models in lib/models/ map Firestore data to typed Dart objects.
- Security: Rules plus Firebase Authentication enforce authorization; sensitive operations should be validated on Cloud Functions where needed.

Typical Request Flow (example: creating an announcement)

1. Admin opens announcement_page.dart and fills the announcement form.
