This folder is used for image assets for the app.

Place the iBrgy logo PNG file here with the filename:

  ibrgy_logo.png

The splash screen and other parts of the app will reference:

  assets/images/ibrgy_logo.png

If you already have the image, copy it into this folder. If you need to download the logo,
save it as a PNG with transparent background for best results.
